This is our submission for a Level-1 Parser.
Primarily we have made changes in parseer.yy and scaner.ll files. Our program acceepts syntactically valid programs;  they may be semantically invalid (eg. undeclared variables, redeclarations of variables, using procedure names as variables, mixing floating and integer values etc.). 

Changes we made are as follows:

1) Deleted the entire actions code in the parser.yy file.
2) Added new token specifications (above level-0)for:
     a. if
     b. else
     c. goto
     d. basic block
     e. relational operators: LE, GE, EQ, NE, LT, GT
     e. double
     f. float
     g.	floating point numbers: FNUM
     h.	[-+*/]
     
   in scanner.ll

3) Modified the Level-0 grammer to Level-2 grammer. Some of the production rules of Level-0 grammer
   were retained, some were modified and some new production rules were added. 

	We modified the production rules for
	 a. declaration_statement
	 b. executable_statement_list,
	 c. assignment_statement
	 d. basic_block
	 e.	variable
	 f.	constant 
	 
	And added some additional production rules for
	 a. comparison
	 b. if_goto_else_goto
	 c. goto_stmt
	 d. operator
	 e. single_term
	 f. inner_comp
	 g. expression
	 h. sub_expr

   Since we are currently implementing only the parser so actions have not been specified for newly added grammer rules in the parser script.
