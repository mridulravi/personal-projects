Assignment 3(a)

This is our first submission for a Level-2 Parser. Primarily we have made changes in parseer.yy and scaner.ll files. Our program acceepts syntactically valid programs;  they may be semantically invalid (eg. undeclared variables, redeclarations of variables, using procedure names as variables, mixing floating and integer values etc.).

 
Changes we made are as follows:

1) Deleted the entire actions code in the parser.yy file.
2) Added new token specifications for:
     a. FLOAT_NUMBER
     b. FLOAT
     c. DOUBLE
   in scanner.ll

3) Modified the Level-1 grammer to Level-2 grammar. Some of the production rules of Level-1 grammer were retained, 
   some were modified and some new production rules were added. 

	We modified the production rules for
	 a. single_term
	 b. variable
	 c. constant
	 
	And added some additional production rules for
	 a. expression
	 b. sub_expr
	 c. data_type

   Since we are currently implementing only the parser so actions have been specified for newly added grammar rules in 
   the parser script.
