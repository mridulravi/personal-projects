Assignment 6(b)

This is our submission for a Level-2 Compiler. We have implemented a complete Compiler 
(Compilation to intermidiate code(with lra) as well as spim code) for Level-2 grammer. 

Primarily we have made changes in files: 
1) parseer.yy
2) scanner.ll 
3) ast.hh
4) ast.cc
5) icode.hh
6) icode.cc
7) reg-alloc.cc

We are supporting "-icode", "-spim" and "-lra" flags only
 
Changes we made are as follows:

1) Added new token specifications for:
     a. double
     b. float
     c. arithmetic operators: PLUS, MINUS, MULT, DIV, UMINUS
   in scanner.ll

2) Modified the Level-1 grammer to Level-2 grammer. Some of the production rules of Level-1 grammer
   were retained, some were modified and some new production rules were added. 

	We modified rules for 
	 a. Constant
	 b. single_term

	And added some additional production rules for
	 a. expression
	 b. sub_expr
	 c. data_type
   
3) We have added 4 new classes - Relational_Ast, GoTo_Ast, Conditional_Ast and successor
		- All these publicy inherit Ast class
		- Relational_Ast is for relational operators
		- Conditional_Ast is for if-else statements
		- GoTo_Ast is for goto statements
		- successor class is for storing the successor of the block(in case of goto statements and goto of if-else statements)
	We also added Arithmetic_Ast and Type_Ast classes
		
4) We have added classes Arithmetic_IC_Stmt and Convert_IC_Stmt in icode.hh and defined their functions and constructors in icode.cc. We have also added instructions in spim_instruction_table

5) We have also added floating point registers and added a new function get_new_float_register

6) We have changed the compile_and_optimize_ast functions of the Ast classes in ast.cc files

7) We have made changes in optimize_lra function in reg_code.cc
