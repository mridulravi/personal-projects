Assignment 5(b)

This is our final submission for a Level-1 Parser. We have implemented a complete interpreter 
(including semantic checks and interpretation) for Level-1 grammer. 

Primarily we have made changes in files: 
1) parseer.yy
2) scanner.ll 
3) ast.hh
4) ast.cc
5) icode.hh
6) icode.cc
7) reg-alloc.cc

Right now we are supporting -icode and -spim flag only
 
Changes we made are as follows:

1) Added new token specifications for:
     a. if
     b. else
     c. goto
     d. basic block
     e. relational operators: LE, GE, EQ, NE, LT, GT
   in scanner.ll

2) Modified the Level-0 grammer to Level-1 grammer. Some of the production rules of Level-0 grammer
   were retained, some were modified and some new production rules were added. 

	We modified the production rules for
	 a. executable_statement_list,
	 b. assignment_statement
	 c. basic_block
	 
	And added some additional production rules for
	 a. comparison
	 b. if_goto_else_goto
	 c. goto_stmt
	 d. operator
	 e. single_term
	 f. inner_comp
   
3) We have added 4 new classes - Relational_Ast, GoTo_Ast, Conditional_Ast and successor
		- All these publicy inherit Ast class
		- Relational_Ast is for relational operators
		- Conditional_Ast is for if-else statements
		- GoTo_Ast is for goto statements
		- successor class is for storing the successor of the block(in case of goto statements and goto of if-else statements)
		
4) We have added classes Relational_IC_Stmt and Control_Flow_IC_Stmt in icode.hh and defined their functions and constructors in icode.cc. We have also added instructions in spim_instruction_table
