	The tar contains 2 folders and two files : 

		1. Buffered : consists of files which implement buffered writes.
				First.java  : the main code
				measure_buffered_write.java : java file to measure the performance of buffered writes
                                web.xml : the sevlet xml file.

		2. Direct : consists of files which implement a write which will update the files as the write happens.
				First.java  : the main code
				measure_direct_write.java : java file to measure the performance of direct writes
                                web.xml : the sevlet xml file.

                3. README : this file itself.

		4. RESULTS.txt : comparison of write performance between the two cases.

PS. The both xml files are the same but First.java are different in both the folders. You have to run the buffered and direct java 
files separately i.e. after removing one First.java you can run the other First.java.
 

	Put the movieinfo.csv and movieratings.csv files in HOME folder

	URL:	http://localhost:8080/First

	To compile: javac -cp "/usr/share/tomcat7/lib/servlet-api.jar" First.java


	

	To measure performance :

	1. Buffered writes : put it in the same folder as First.java in Buffered folder. Compile the First.java as above, restart 
                             the tomcat server and compile and run as 
                     
                             javac measure_buffered_write.java 
                             java measure_buffered_write

	1. Direct writes : put it in the same folder as First.java in Buffered folder. Compile the First.java as above, restart 
                           the tomcat server and compile and run as 
                     
                             javac measure_direct_write.java 
                             java measure_direct_write
