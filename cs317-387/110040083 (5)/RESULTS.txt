RESULTS OBTAINED : For 1000 iterations

     Time                           For buffered write		         For direct write
  When files are being updated            20 sec                            23 sec
  Otherwise                               280 ms                            1300 ms


where, direct write : write through policy which will update the files as the write happens.
       buffered write :  Implement buffered writes by having a timer and a separate thread that periodically (when the timer goes 
                          off) writes out the data to files rather than on every write. 

Clearly buffered write is more efficient than direct write.
