1)HUFFMAN CODING--In huffman coding we have 2 programs first one is huffman_write.cpp,second is huffman_read.cpp
	-->compile both the programs separately
	-->huffman_write is for compresing a text file, it will ask fot the file name which is to be compressed.
	-->the file needs to be present in the same directory as the executable
	-->compile it as g++ -o encoder huffman_write.cpp
	-->run as ./encoder
		
	-->huffman_read will give the original file back from the compressed file
	-->the compressed files need to be present in the same directory as the executable
	-->compile it as g++ -o decode huffman_read.cpp
	-->run as ./decoder

2)TRIE 1--compile it as g++ -o trie *.cpp
	-->run as ./trie

3)TRIE 2--compile it as g++ -o trie -std=c++0x trie.cpp ,since i have used unordered_map inside the function
	-->run as ./trie

4)BST--for compiling 
	qmake -project
	qmake
	make
	-->run as ./bst

5)LIST-- for compiling
	qmake -project
	qmake
	make
	-->run as ./list

6)QUEUE--for compiling
	qmake -project
	qmake
	make
	-->run as ./queue

7)STACK--for compiling
	qmake -project
	qmake
	make	
	-->run as ./stack
