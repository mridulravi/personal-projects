ver2ssq: Version 2 of Single server queue implementation (ver0 and ver 1 were simpler)

Read comments to understand code.

Best to read in the following order:

main
QueueingSystem: header, then cpp
Request: header, then cpp
Event: header, then cpp
Simulation: header, then cpp
declarations: header only


In addition, make file, which will create a "qsim" executable.

Also there is a queuesim.in file which is the trace input, at the end
of it I have created the simulation trace by hand, for
debugging. Current code SEEMS correct.
