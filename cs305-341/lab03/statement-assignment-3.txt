Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) – an asymmetric key cryptographic scheme - has gained wide acceptance 
in the recent past. Operations on finite fields (an algebraic structure) are used in ECC operations such
 as encryption, decryption, signature generation/verification and authentication. To accelerate these 
time-consuming operations, developers sometimes program them in assembly language. 

Two fields of particular interest are prime fields and binary fields.
The goal of this lab assignment is to implement “addition” and “multiplication” in binary fields 
(recall the lecture in class on these) on a MIPS simulator.

PART A :
The program should prompt the user to enter the following:
n (the logarithm of the size of the binary field (to base 2))
Two field elements (each in hex)
The operation – whether + or *
The irreducible polynomial (in hex) if the operation is *
The program should output the result in hex.
Assume that the size of the field is at most 2^16.

PART B (to be given in the lab on 07-07-13 )
