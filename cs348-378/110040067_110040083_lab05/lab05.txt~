Exercise 1: Adress Resolution Protocol (ARP)


• Within subnet
  `````````````
1) We first open the terminal write the command "tcpdump -n host 10.105.11.22 -w /tmp/trace1.out"
2) Next open another tab in terminal and write "ping 10.105.11.22" 

	10.105.11.22 belongs to an osl machine which is within the host subnet. As you can see in the trace file 
	our source host broadcasts the message "Who has 10.105.11.22 ?" and gets the reply "10.105.11.22  is at 70:54:b2:1b:32:b6"
	Two arp messages were exchanged in this cases one of them was the broadcast request message and other one was reply arp 
	message carrying the MAC address of 10.105.11.22. Thus arp entires correspond to remote host IP address which we contacted.
	
• Outside subnet
  ``````````````
1) We first open the terminal write the command "tcpdump -n host 10.7.130.250 -w /tmp/trace2.out"
2) Next open another tab in terminal and write "ping 10.7.130.250" 

	10.7.130.250 is outside our host subnet(hostel machine) and the packet goes via router. As host is outside the subnet no arp 
	messages are generated. No arp entry corresponds to the remote host IP address we contacted.	
	
• Non existent host
  `````````````````
1) We first open the terminal write the command "tcpdump -n host 10.105.11.252 -w /tmp/trace3.out"
2) Next open another tab in terminal and write "ping -c 1 10.105.11.252"

	When we try to send a packet to a non existent host within the same subnet we do not get any reply. We limited the ping count 
	to 1 time (otherwise the arp packets keep on generating), and in this case 3 ARP attempts were made to resolve the 
	non-existing IP address. Last attempt is made at time 1.999880 sec.

Exercise 2: Gratuitous ARP

1) To generate the arp traces use commands 
	For Gratuitous reply "arping -A -c 5 -I eth0 10.105.11.31"
			     "tcpdump -n host 10.105.11.31 -w /tmp/trace4.out"
	For Gratuitous request "arping -U -c 5 -I eth0 10.105.11.31"
			     "tcpdump -n host 10.105.11.31 -w /tmp/trace5.out"
	
2) In all Gratuitous ARP packets, destination MAC is broadcast(ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) in Ethernet protocol. This ensures that gratuitous 
   ARPs reach all hosts within the physical network.

3) Difference between Gratuitous ARP request and reply: 
   (i)  In request, Target MAC Address in ARP protocol is host's own MAC address whereas in reply,  Target MAC in ARP protocol is
        broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff). 
   (ii) Opcode of reply is 2 and request has opcode 1.

Exercise 3: IP Fragmentation

1) No fragmentaion: "tcpdump -n host 10.105.11.30 -w /tmp/trace6.out"
		    "./sendUDP 10.105.11.30 200"

	Total length: 242  bytes (on wire)
	Identifier: 0x0000
	Flags: 0x02
	Fragment offset: 0

2) Fragmentation: "tcpdump -n host 10.105.11.30 -w /tmp/trace7.out"
		    "./sendUDP 10.105.11.30 2000"
	
	• Frame1:
	
	Total length: 1514 bytes (on wire)
	Identifier: 0x1b21
	Flags: 0x01
	Fragment offset: 0
		
	• Frame2:
			
	Total length: 562 bytes (on wire)
	Identifier: 0x1b21
	Flags: 0x00
	Fragment offset: 1480

Exercise 4: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

1) DHCP has an IP address : 10.129.1.53 and is listening at port 67

2) No relay was involved in in forwarding the DHCP packets because of:
	(i)  the relay agent IP address is 0.0.0.0 in DHCP discover and DHCP offer.
	(ii) there is no hop in between the server and system as can be seen in the trace file.
	 
3) It replied to IP address:10.129.26.130
   Reason: It already had this IP address and this time it is asking for a renewal of this IP address. Therefore destination replies
   with this IP address. And flag is also set to 0x00.

4) Offered IP address:10.129.26.130
   It is valid for 10 min (figured out by Address Lease Time)

5) Additional information has the client received from the DHCP server

   Subnet Mask: 255.255.128.0
   Router: 10.129.1.250
   Domain name: it.iitb.ac.in, cse.iitb.ac.in
   Domain Name Server: 10.129.1.1
   IP address lease time: 10 min
   DHCP Server Identifier: 10.129.1.53

Exercise 5:  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

• Type 0, code 0 : Echo reply (ping)

	"tcpdump -n host 10.7.130.250 -w /tmp/trace8.out"
	"ping -c 2 10.7.130.250"
	
	Please look at trace file 8.

• Type 3, code 3 : Destination port unreachable

	"tcpdump -n icmp -w /tmp/trace9.out"
	"tracepath www.cse.iitb.ac.in"
	
	Please look at trace file 9.

• Type 8, code 0 : Echo request (ping)


	"tcpdump -n host 10.7.130.250 -w /tmp/trace8.out"
	"ping -c 2 10.7.130.250"
	
	Please look at trace file 8.

Exercise 6:  More Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

1) Command used:"tcpdump -n host 10.7.130.250 -w /tmp/trace10.out"
		"tracepath 10.7.130.250"

   Output:
   
    1:  osl-30.cse.iitb.ac.in                                 0.103ms pmtu 1500
    1:  router.cse.iitb.ac.in                                 1.111ms 
    1:  router.cse.iitb.ac.in                                 1.246ms 
    2:  10.250.105.1                                          1.139ms 
    3:  192.0.20.2                                            1.514ms 
    4:  172.16.0.5                                            2.670ms 
    5:  router-hostel7.hostel7.iitb.ac.in                     1.770ms reached
        Resume: pmtu 1500 hops 5 back 251 


2) ICMP message type/code is involved in the processes are:
   Type: 11(Time-to-live exceeded) 
   Code: 0(Time-to-live exceeded in transit)


3) Tracepath traces a path to a designated network address, reporting on the "time to live" or TTL lag and maximum transmission units 
   (MTU) along the way. 
   First column shows TTL of the probe, followed by colon.
   Second column shows the network hop.
   Third column shows the round trip time from host to the corrsponding hop(RTT)
   Additionally it shows the Path MTU whenever it changes.
   Last line summarizes information about all the path to the destination
   
   How does this command works?
   
   TTL value is sent as 1. The value is decremented by First hop, and it becomes 0. So hop1 will send the host a packet informing about that packet 
   is expired which helps host to know about hop1. 

   Now, TTL value is sent as 2. The value is decremented by First hop and then by Second hop, and it becomes 0. So hop2 will send the host a packet 
   informing about that packet is expired which helps host to know about hop2. 
   
   and so on.

4) IP address of default router is 10.105.250.1
