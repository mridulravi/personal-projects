EXERCISE 2:-

Ques1)
Machine's Hostname
osl-37
The command used to get this is -- cat /etc/hostname

Machine's IP address
10.105.11.37
The command used to get this is -- cat /etc/network/interfaces | grep address | awk '{print $2;}'


Ques2)
Next hop router's IP address
10.105.1.250
The command used t0 get this is -- route | grep default | awk '{print $2}'

Next hop router's mac address 
00:19:56:ed:66:c1
The command used to get is -- "arp" and then looking at the mac address of the row with the ip address of the next hop router


Ques3)
IP address of the DNS server
10.105.1.7
The command used is - cat /etc/resolv.conf

The name of the DNS server is 
rsl-jeeves.cse.iitb.ac.in
The command used is -- host <ip-address of the DNS server>


Ques4)
The numbers in the /etc/protocols file represent the "protocol numbers" 
or(in a better way)  "the official number for this protocol as it will appear within the IP header"

The format in the /etc/protocols is
Name	Number	Aliases


Ques5)
The port no's for the services are:-
ssh	22
ftp	21
nfs	2049
smtp	25

The command used to get this is -- cat /etc/services | grep <service name> 



EXERCISE 3:-

Report:

Ques1) tcpdump -n host 10.105.1.3 -w /tmp/abhishek/exercise3.out
then we opened the url using - wget --no-proxy http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~chebrolu
Then we closed the connection in tcpdump using ctrl-C

Ques2(a)
First use the route command to get the details of the gateways. There we find that for IP address 10.105.1.3 we don't have to go through any router, so in this case(i.e for CSE website) the next-hop is same as the final destination

Next hop - cse.iitb.ac.in
Ip address - 10.105.1.3
The MAC address is - 02:01:02:03:02:09

We opened the trace file in wireshark and looked at the first entry, all the details can be found in the options given below
(For Eg: The MAC address can be found in the Ethernet II option )

Ques2(b)
Final destination - cse.iitb.ac.in
Ip address - 10.105.1.3
The MAC address is - 02:01:02:03:02:09

We opened the trace file in wireshark and looked at the last entry, all the details can be found in the options given below
(For Eg: The MAC address can be found in the Ethernet II option )


Ques2(c)
The fields used at the link(Ethernet), IP and TCP headers to demux the packet at the destination are as follows:-
Link Layer - Frame Type
IP Layer - Protocol
TCP Layer - Port number

Their values in this case(in decimal) is:-
Link layer - IP(0x0800) = 2048
IP layer - TCP (6) 
TCP layer - http(80)



EXERCISE 4:-

Ques1)
tcpdump -n -w /tmp/abhishek/exercise4.out
ping www.google.com						// for icmp protocol
ssh -X abhishekgupta@mars.cse.iitb.ac.in			// for ssh protocol

Basically we open tcpdump and then we ping to get packets using icmp protocol, and login through ssh to get packets using ssh protocol.

Ques2(a)
The stack is as follows:-

Ethernet II
Address Resolution Protocol

Ques2(b)
The value of the field used in Ethernet header is ARP(0x0806) = 2054



Ques3(a)
Ethernet II
Internet Protocol Version 4
Internet Control Message Protocol


Ques3(b)
It is passed to IP protocol. It's value is 0x0800 = 2048 (in decimal)

Ques3(c)
The fields are :-
Protocol - ICMP(1)


Ques4(a)
Source: 10.8.12.163 (10.8.12.163)
Destination: 10.105.11.56 (10.105.11.56)

Ques4(b)
Source port: ssh (22)
Destination port: 52777 (52777)

Ques4(c)
10.8.12.163



EXERCISE 5:-

Ques1)
tcpdump -n host mars.cse.iitb.ac.in -w /tmp/abhishek/exercise5.out
Terminal1: ssh -X abhishekgupta@mars.cse.iitb.ac.in
Terminal2: ssh -X abhishekgupta@mars.cse.iitb.ac.in

Ques2)
The port number used by the remote machine for first and second ssh session is same and is 22.
The source port number is different for both sessions (41833 for 1st one and 41834 for second one). So it distinguishes between the 2 sessions using their port no.

Ques3)
The TCP layer figures this out using the destination port. The destination port will be different for both (in my case, 1st terminal is at port 41833 while the second one is at port 41834)

For First login:
Destination port: 41833 (41833)

For second login:
Destination port: 41834 (41834)
