                           Lab 04: Link layer preliminaries
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 2:

1.  MAC Address: 70:54:d2:1b:32:c8
    Command : ifconfig eth0 | grep -i "HWaddr"
    
    IPv4 Address: 10.105.11.33
    Command : ifconfig eth0 | grep -i "inet addr"
    
    IPv6 Address: fe80::7254:d2ff:fe1b:32c8/64
    Command : ifconfig eth0 | grep -i "inet6 addr"
    
2.  MTU stands for maximum transmission unit of a communicaton protocol. It is the size 
	(in bytes) of the largest protocol data unit that the layer can pass onwards. (Ref Wikipedia)
	MTU size of the interface : 1500 bytes
	Command: ifconfig eth0 | grep -i MTU
	
3.	Ethernet of our machine is operating in FULL DUPLEX mode at a speed of 100 Mbps over Twisted 
	pair cable.
	
	Commands: 
	ethtool eth0 | grep -i Duplex
	ethtool eth0 | grep -i speed
	ethtool eth0 | grep -i port
	
4.  Recieved Packets: 15384385		Dropped Packets: 74412
	Transmitted Packets: 4037448	Dropped Packets: 0
	
	Command:
	ifconfig eth0 | grep -i TX
	ifconfig eth0 | grep -i RX
	
5. 	On running the two commands: 
	Received packets:
	netstat -i    			 ifconfig eth0 | grep -i RX 
	 15429200                      15429207 
	
	Transmitted packets:
	netstat -i    			 ifconfig eth0 | grep -i TX 
	 4088139                       4088135 

	Reason: Since the interface is active, the difference arises because of the time difference 
	between running the two commands. We figured this out by running the commands at different 
	time gaps and noticed the difference between the number of transmitted and recieved packets.  
	If you run both the commands simultaneously, i.e. "netstat -i && ifconfig eth0" then the 
	difference in the no of packets will be 0.
	
	
6.	Command: ifconfig eth0 | grep -i collision 
	Result:	0
	Reason: Our system is directly connected to switch in full duplex mode(STAR topology in full 
	duplex mode) which results in no collisions
	
7.	Transmitted Bytes: 2542107905 (2.5 GB)
	Command: ifconfig eth0 | grep -i "TX bytes"
	
	Recieved Bytes: 3802803498 (3.8 GB)
	Command: ifconfig eth0 | grep -i "RX bytes"
	
8.	Manufacturer of the Ethernet card: PEGATRON CORPORATION
	
9.	lo stands for loopback interface. It is software loopback mechanism which may be used for 
	performance analysis, software testing, and/or local communication. It does not have a MAC
	address because it is a virtual network interface.
	
	Experiment:
	(1) Open bash terminal and type command: tcpdump -i lo
	(2) Now open another tab in terminal window and type: ping www.google.co.in
	(3) Note any changes in first tab of the terminal.
	(4) Now close connection to www.google.co.in and ping 127.0.0.1
	(5) Note any changes in first tab of the terminal.
	
	Observations:
	(1) When we ping www.google.co.in, tcpdump -i lo does not capture any traffic.
	(2) When we ping 127.0.0.1(localhost), tcpdump -i lo shows numerous packets being captured.
	
	Conclusions:
	(1) Observation (1) shows that lo does not interfere with our network interface controller.
	(2) Observation (2) shows that loopback network interface is used as a virtual network
	interface through which applications can connect while running on same machine.	

10.	Default Gateway MAC address: 00:19:56:ed:66:c1
	Command: First we used the command "netstat -r -n" to find out the IP address of default gateway,
	which came out to be 10.105.1.250   Then we used command "arp 10.105.1.250" to find out the MAC 
	address(00:19:56:ed:66:c1).
